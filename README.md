# Template Simple Project

This is a project template that I use for all simple Python projects. It is designed to speed up the process of creating new projects by allowing you to focus on the use case right away.
This project includes general settings and configuration, as well as a sample of how to use multiprocessing to improve the efficiency of processing large amounts of data.
